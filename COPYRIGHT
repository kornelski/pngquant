The quantization and dithering code in pngquant is lifted from Jef Poskanzer's
'ppmquant', part of his wonderful PBMPLUS tool suite.

Greg Roelofs hacked it into a (in his words) "slightly cheesy" 'pamquant' back
in 1997 (see http://pobox.com/~newt/greg_rgba.html) and finally he ripped out
the cheesy file-I/O parts and replaced them with nice PNG code in December
2000. The PNG reading and writing code is a merged and slightly simplified
version of readpng, readpng2, and writepng from his book:

   "PNG: The Definitive Guide."

Pngquant therefore inherits both licenses, one for each source file.

Note that both licenses are basically BSD-like; that is, use the code however
you like, as long as you acknowledge its origins.
