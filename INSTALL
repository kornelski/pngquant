To build pngquant from source on Mac OS X and most Linux distributions,
simply run:

      $ make

It will create pngquant executable in the current directory. If you'd like
to install it system-wide:

      $ sudo make install

By default it will be installed in /usr/local/bin. To install it in another
directory set PREFIX or DESTDIR environmental variables.

pngquant uses GNU Makefile. To compile on FreeBSD you will need to use gmake,
and on Windows the MinGW compiler (MSVC does not support C99).


##Compilation with custom libpng and zlib

If you have custom libpng and zlib compiled, you can specify their paths:

      $ CUSTOMLIBPNG=/path/to/libpng/ CUSTOMZLIB=/path/to/zlib/ make

Alternatively, you can build your own versions in ../zlib and ../libpng
directories. Use this only if you can't get your system's libpng/zlib to work.

1. Download the zlib source code from:
   http://www.zlib.net/

      $ cd ..
      $ wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz?download

   Unpack it into the parent directory of the 'pngquant' directory and rename
   it to 'zlib' - e.g.:

      $ tar zxf zlib-1.2.5.tar.gz
      $ mv zlib-1.2.5 zlib

   Build it:

      $ make

2. Download the libpng source code from:
   http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html - e.g.:

      $ cd ..
      $ wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/libpng-1.2.46.tar.gz?download

   Unpack it into the parent directory of the 'pngquant' directory and rename
   it to 'libpng' - e.g.:

      $ tar zxf libpng-1.2.46.tar.gz
      $ mv libpng-1.2.46 libpng

   Build libpng:

      $ cd libpng
      $ ./configure && make

3. Go back to the pngquant directory and make using the Makefile make file:

      $ cd ../pngquant/
      $ make


##Compilation for 32-bit x86

pngquant will use SSE2 instructions only when compiled for x86-64. If you want
to enable SSE2 optimisation on 32-bit Intel, add -DUSE_SSE=1 to CFLAGS.

##Compilation with OpenMP

     $ make openmp

This makes pngquant faster in wall-clock time on multicore machines when one
image at a time is processed.

However, it significantly increases total CPU time used, and thus it's not
recommended for server-side and parallelized batch jobs which run many pngquant
instances at a time.
